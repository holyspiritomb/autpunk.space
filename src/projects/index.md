# Projects

Sometimes I do things.

## pyXyzzy custom

* Repository: https://gitlab.com/holyspiritomb/pyxyzzy-custom
* Deployment (not current): https://pyx.hamster.dance

A fork of a clone of Cards Against Humanity, that I'm doing my best to develop and maintain in my spare time. It's been a steep learning curve: I started learning typescript purely to understand the old frontend code, and I don't know enough python to mess around with the backend. Somedayâ„¢ I intend to figure out

- how to make one command start both the frontend and backend
- how to implement an admin page in the frontend
- color schemes
- blank cards with user-provided input
- how to make it go on nixOS[^1]

[^1]: It's deployed on my partner's VPS running nixOS, their preferred Linux distro, which I have no experience with.

## Available Reads Forked

* Repository: https://github.com/holyspiritomb/goodreads
