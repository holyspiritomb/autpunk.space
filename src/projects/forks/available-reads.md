Do you like to read library books? Do you use Goodreads to find books to read? Do you use Libby to read ebooks and audiobooks from your library for free? Then you might like this browser extension that tells you when a book you're looking at on Goodreads is available on Libby. It works on Android Firefox too! (Sort of.)
