# Unsorted Fragments

This place is for unsorted, largely unpolished prose fragments that I've made on various topics, organized only by year. Titles are what I named the files in my text editor at the time, or the date it was last edited before I put it here.

::: warning
I will do my best to affix content warnings and labels of "No Content Warnings Apply." As a multiply disabled autistic person with executive dysfunction, however, I might forget to put warnings on occasion.

What I think about and write about includes eating disorders, disability politics, queer & trans intra-community dynamics and politics, asexual community discourse, multiple types of abuse (including CSA), and moral injury. Please use discretion and take care of yourself, and treat anything without an explicit "No Content Warnings Apply" label as you'd treat "Author Chose Not to Use Content Warnings."
