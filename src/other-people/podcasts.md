* <a href="https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/oh-no-ross-and-carrie/">Oh no, Ross and Carrie!</a> involved Ross and Carrie undercover-investigating various cults, pseudoscience communities and wellness trends, and reporting on their experiences. This is the kind of debunking podcast that *doesn't* take the position that people who believe in pseudoscience and pseudomedicine deserve mockery, which is a level of compassion I need when I listen to episodes about wellness trends that I once believed in. I highly recommend their investigative series about Scientology.
